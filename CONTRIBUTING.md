# Requirements
Create folder named for the challenge with the following:
1. A README.md file following the format of the existing files in the repo.
2. A savegame folder, if required to start from a savegame. This folder
should not be numbered like FS does, but instead just named 'savegame'
Exception to this is if supporting multiple versions of FS, you can do
'savegame_FS19' and 'savegame_FS22'
