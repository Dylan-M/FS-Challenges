## Mods
A lot. All can be found on either the official ModHub or fs19.net - with

## Goal

### Solo

## Rules
1. Only the provided mods are allowed.
2. Must start from the provided save game.
3. Store is hidden (can still be accessed from menu) because you're not allowed to purchase anything.
4. Log cabin home can be purchased for $10,000. It is the only exception to the previous rule. However, it has conditions:
-- 4a. Must harvest and sell a minimum of 25 trees prior to purchasing the cabin. Lumberjack mod will be enabled for stump removal.
-- 4b. Must place it in a location that is not a numbered field or in the roadway.
5. Equipment will be scattered and hidden throughout the island. None of it will show on the map, yet you'll be able to use it. Some of the equipment will need to be repaired before it can be used, other pieces not.
6. No super strength.
7. No workers
8. MP version of challenge limited to 4 players, but works best with just 2.

## Background
You're a survivor (or group of survivors in multiplayer) of a shipwreck.
You've washed up on the beach of this island, coming ashore where you saw
some buildings on the way in. Despite the obvious buildings, the island
appears to be uninhabited, and much of what you find is damaged or
destroyed. However, there is some operable farming equipment. There are
fields that have been growing random and wild with no one to maintain them.
Additionally there are animals that have survived as well: sheep and
chickens.

## Platform Support
Computer Only, due to the mods used and being started from a savegame.
