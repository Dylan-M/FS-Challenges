# JayBot100 Challenge
With FS22 quickly coming around, I want to celebrate FS19. How, I hear you ask? Well, back when FS19 was weeks away from being released, I was enjoying playing on Sussex Farms and Mercury Farm on Xbox One. 
Mercury Farm being the last ever map i played on FS17. I wish to follow tradition and have an Alien Jim map as my last 'Hurrah' of playing on FS19. I therefore challenge you to join me as I celebrate FS19.  
  
I introduce to you... 'The JayBot100 Challenge'
